[Features]

- so much more to be added to this, unless its just meant to be a placeholder for the ci/cd pipeline & devops practice

[Bugs]

- Gui doesn't extend to the bottom of the screen when the conversation is too long (+ no scrolling)
- empty conversations should be removed
- the users message should appear even while the response is loading
- search functionality should filter conversation history
- conversations should be named based on initial message not default names
